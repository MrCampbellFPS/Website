            Bergeron was born on July, 24 1985(age 34). He was born in L'Ancienne-Lorette, Quebec, Canda. Selected by the Boston Bruins in the second round (No. 45) in the 2003 NHL Draft, Bergeron arrived that fall, all of 18 years old, and impressed with 16 goals and 39 points in 71 games and finished eighth in the Calder Trophy voting. In Game 7 of the 2011 Stanley Cup Finals, Bergeron scored two goals as the Bruins claimed their sixth title over seven hard-fought games against the Vancouver Canucks. That made Bergeron a member of the elite Triple Gold Club, reserved for players who've won a gold medal at the Olympics and World Championship, and the Stanley Cup.In 2011-12, he led the League in plus-minus (plus 36), finished second in faceoff win percentage (59.3) and won his first Selke Trophy as the top defensive forward. He also had 64 points. He would win the Selke in 2014, 2015 and 2017, joining Hockey Hall of Famer Bob Gainey as the only players to win the award four times.
