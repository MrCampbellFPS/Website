        <h2>Player Bio</h2>
        <p id="bio">
            Carlo was born on November 26, 1996 (age 22) in Colorado Springs, Colorado, USA. Carlo was introduced to hockey at age 5 when he started playing roller hockey with his neighbors and quickly fell in love with it. He grew up idolizing Hockey Hall of Fame defenseman Rob Blake after he saw him play for the Colorado Avalanche while attending his first NHL game. Carlo won a silver medal at age 16 playing with the United States at the 2013 Ivan Hlinka Memorial Cup and twice competed in the IIHF World Junior Championship, winning bronze in 2016. He was selected by the Boston Bruins in the second round (No. 27) of the 2015 NHL Draft and signed a three-year, entry-level contract on Sept. 25 of that year. After three seasons with Tri-City of the Western Hockey League, Carlo made his professional debut with Providence of the American Hockey League on April 1, 2016, playing seven games there in 2015-16. The following season, Carlo made the Bruins out of training camp. He had an assist in his first NHL game at the Columbus Blue Jackets on Oct. 13, 2016, and scored his first NHL goal at the Winnipeg Jets four days later. Often playing with veteran defenseman Zdeno Chara, Carlo had 16 points (six goals, 10 assists), was plus-9 and averaged 20:48 of ice time in 82 games. However, a concussion sustained in the final game of the regular season kept Carlo out of Boston's six-game loss to the Ottawa Senators in the Eastern Conference First Round of the Stanley Cup Playoffs.
