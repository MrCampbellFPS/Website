        <h2>Player Bio</h2>
        <p id="bio">
            Krejci was born on April 28, 1986 (age 33) in Sternberk, Czech republic. On June 15, 2011, Krejci got what he'd come for. Drafted and developed by the Boston Bruins, Krejci was Czech teenager who'd followed his dream from his hometown of Sternberk to North America to help end a championship drought in an Original Six hockey hotbed and be able to hoist the Stanley Cup over his head. Dream fulfilled. Top of the world. Not to mention top of the NHL postseason scoring charts. Krejci started slowly that spring, registering only a point in the opening-round Stanley Cup Playoff series against the rival Montreal Canadiens. Then he caught fire, toasting the Philadelphia Flyers for four goals and nine points, the Tampa Bay Lightning for five goals and seven points and, finally, the Vancouver Canucks for two goals and six points. Game Six of the Eastern Conference Final against Tampa Bay turned out to be particularly memorable, with Krejci scoring three times to become the first Bruin since Cam Neely 20 years earlier to get a playoff hat trick. Twenty three points in 25 postseason games. Selected by the Bruins in the second round (No. 63) in the 2004 NHL Draft directly out of the HC Kladno junior program in the Czech Republic, Krejci set out to fast-track his NHL readiness by joining Gatineau of the Quebec Major Junior Hockey League, where he scored 49 goals and 144 points in two seasons. Midway through his second season with Providence of the American Hockey League, Krejci was called up and scored 27 points in 56 games. The following season, 2007-2008, witnessed his arrival as an offensive force, a 51-assist, 73-point season, and he led the League with a plus-37 rating. The momentum of Krejci's career, however, has been sporadically interrupted by injury: a concussion in January 2007, a dislocated wrist during the 2010 postseason and a partial tear of the MCL in his left knee in February 2015. He also missed time in 2009 after being diagnosed with the H1N1 virus. Despite the missed time, the Bruins signed Krejci to a six-year contract extension on Sept. 4, 2014
