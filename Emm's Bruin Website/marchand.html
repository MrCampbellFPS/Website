        <h2>Player Bio</h2>
        <p id="bio">
            Marchand was born on May, 11 1988 (age 31). He was born in Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada. The Boston Bruins selected him in the third round (No. 71) of the 2006 NHL Draft. Early in the 2009-10 season, Marchand was called up by the Bruins and had an assist in his NHL debut, a 3-2 victory against the Nashville Predators on Oct. 21, 2009. It was his only point in 20 games with Boston. Marchand's first full season as a regular, 2010-11, ended with the Bruins winning the Stanley Cup for the first time since 1972. He had 41 points (21 goals, 20 assists) in the regular season and was 12th in voting for the Calder Trophy, then turned into a major factor in the Stanley Cup Playoffs. In 25 games, he scored 11 goals -- a rookie playoff record for the Bruins -- and finished with 19 points. The Bruins defeated the Vancouver Canucks in a seven-game Final; Marchand scored two goals and added an assist in Boston's 4-0 victory in Game 7.
