        <h2>Player Bio</h2>
        <p id="bio">
            McAvoy was born on December 21, 1997 (age 21) in Long Beach, New York. He grew up a fan of the New York Rangers and Hockey Hall of Fame defenseman Brian Leetch, and attended Long Beach High School for one year before moving to Ann Arbor, Michigan, where he went to Pioneer High School and joined USA Hockey's National Team Development Program. McAvoy spent two seasons with the NTDP, helping the United States win gold at the 2015 IIHF Under-18 World Championship, and joined Boston University as a 17-year-old freshman. In McAvoy's two seasons, the Terriers went 45-25-8 and made the NCAA Championship twice. McAvoy was named a CCM/ACHA First Team All-American as a sophomore, when he had 26 points (five goals, 21 assists) and was plus-9 in 38 games. Chosen by the Boston Bruins with the No. 14 pick in the 2016 NHL Draft, McAvoy made his Stanley Cup Playoff debut in the Eastern Conference First Round against the Ottawa Senators after several injuries to the Bruins defense. He had three assists and averaged 26:12 of ice time -- second on the Bruins and first among NHL rookies -- in the six-game loss.
