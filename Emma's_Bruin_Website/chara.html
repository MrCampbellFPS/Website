        <h2>Player Bio</h2>
        <p id="bio">
            Chara was born on March 18, 1977 (age 42). He was born in Trencin, Slovakia. Known as "Big Z," Chara has cast a huge shadow of accomplishment over the NHL since his arrival as a third-round selection (No. 56) by the New York Islanders in the 1996 NHL Draft. After four seasons with the Islanders, he was traded to the Ottawa Senators. Chara's game continued to evolve in Ottawa, and in 2003 he played in his first NHL All-Star Game. His point totals rose in each of the four seasons after the Senators acquired him from the Islanders. But the Senators decided they couldn't afford to keep both Chara and Wade Redden; in the summer of 2006, they re-signed Redden and let Chara become a free agent. The Bruins quickly signed Chara to a five-year contract on July 1, 2006, and immediately named him captain. In 2010-11, Chara led the NHL in plus-minus rating (plus-33) and finished with 44 points (14 goals, 30 assists), helping the Bruins win the Stanley Cup for the first time since 1972. His plus-16 rating during the postseason was also a League-high. Chara had his best offensive season in 2011-12 with 52 points (12 goals, 40 assists). In 2013-14, he scored 17 goals and finished with 40 points and a plus-25 rating, earning a berth on the First All-Star Team for the third time in his career. The feats of the Bruins captain have been well documented: Recipient of the Norris Trophy as the best defenseman in the NHL in 2009. Only the second European born-and-trained captain to lift the Stanley Cup, after Nicklas Lidstrom of the Detroit Red Wings, and the first from a country behind the Iron Curtain (Czechoslovakia). Flag bearer for Slovakia during the 2014 Sochi Olympics. A three-time NHL First-Team All-Star. Holds the record for hardest shot at the All-Star Skills Competition (108.8 mph, in 2012). He has continued to be effective into his early 40s, taking a regular shift while helping to mentor the next generation of Boston defensemen, including Brandon Carlo and Charlie McAvoy.
