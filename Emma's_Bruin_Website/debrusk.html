        <h2>Player Bio</h2>
        <p id="bio">
            Jake DeBrusk was born on October 17,1996 (age 23) in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada. DeBrusk is a second-generation NHL player. His father, Louie DeBrusk, played 401 games for the Edmonton Oilers, Tampa Bay Lightning, Phoenix Coyotes and Chicago Blackhawks. The elder DeBrusk was an enforcer, piling up 1,161 penalty minutes while generating 41 points (24 goals, 17 assists). Jake DeBrusk is a left wing who can score. The best of his three seasons in the Western Hockey League came at the right time; he had 81 points (42 goals, 39 assists) in 72 games for Swift Current in 2014-15. That attracted the attention of the Boston Bruins, who selected him with the first of their three consecutive first-round picks (No. 14) in the 2015 NHL Draft. The Bruins signed DeBrusk to a three-year, entry-level contract on Nov. 12, 2015, and after one more season in the WHL, he turned pro and was assigned to Providence of the American Hockey League, where he had 49 points (19 goals, 30 assists) in 74 games, then scored six goals and finished with nine points in 17 Calder Cup Playoff games. DeBrusk earned a spot on the Bruins at training camp in 2017 and wasted no time scoring his first NHL goal; he beat Pekka Rinne of the Nashville Predators in his debut on Oct. 5, 2017. By midseason, he was a regular on the Bruins' second line and had helped Boston to one of the hottest stretches in its nine-plus decades in the NHL.
